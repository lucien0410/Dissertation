Attempts to improve machine translation systems by incorporating explicit linguistic information are reported in the literature. Syntax information is known to be effective in improving statiscal machine translation (SMT), yeilding seperate type of SMT, termed as syntax-based SMT \citep{williams2016syntax}. Similar methords are also found in neural net machine translation. For example, \citet{sennrich2016linguistic} exploit the information of lemmas, part of tags, morphology of words, and dependency parses of sentences to improve MT systems. \citet{ccg_target_seq} incorpote the categorial grammar parse tags of the target sequecnes.

The Parallel-Partial treatment actually may be viewed as form of multi-task Sequence to Sequence Learning \citep{luong2015multi}. Specifically, the parallel part of the treatment is very similar to the data manipulation used in building multi-language translation systems \citep{google_zero_shot}.

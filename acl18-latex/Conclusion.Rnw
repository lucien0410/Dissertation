\section{Conclusion}
I introduce an very effective way of incorporating the gloss data into neural net machine translation systems. The immediate merit is that it works. Additional, how theoretical linguistics may work hand in hand with natural language processing, and how neural net machine learning may exploit linguistics are important questions in both fields (see \citet{pater2017generative} for a nice discussion on this topic). In addition to practically building better MT systems, the current work also exemplifies how theoretical linguistics may work hand in hand with natural language processing successfully.

\slide{Goals for Evaluation Metrics}
\vspace{25mm}
\begin{description}
\item[Low cost:] reduce time and money spent on carrying out evaluation
\item[Tunable:] automatically optimize system performance towards metric
\item[Meaningful:] score should give intuitive interpretation of translation quality
\item[Consistent:] repeated use of metric should give same results
\item[Correct:] metric must rank better systems higher
\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\slide{Other Evaluation Criteria}
\vspace{27mm}
When deploying systems, considerations go beyond quality of translations
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{description}
\item[Speed:] we prefer faster machine translation systems
\item[Size:] fits into memory of available machines (e.g., handheld devices)
\item[Integration:] can be integrated into existing workflow
\item[Customization:] can be adapted to user's needs 
\end{description}

\item system A has score \maths{$x$} on a test set
\item system B has score \maths{$y$} on the same test set
\item \maths{$x > y$}

\item Is system A really better than system B?
\item In other words:\\
Is the difference in score {\bf statistically significant}?

\slide{Core Concepts}
\vspace{10mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Null hypothesis
\begin{itemize}
\item assumption that there is no real difference
\end{itemize}
\item P-Levels
\begin{itemize}
\item related to probability that there is a true difference
\item p-level \maths{$p<0.01$} = more than \maths{99\%} chance that difference is real
\item typcically used: p-level \maths{$0.05$} or \maths{$0.01$}
\end{itemize}
\item Confidence Intervals
\begin{itemize}
\item given that the measured score is \maths{$x$}
\item what is the true score (on a infinite size test set)?
\item interval \maths{$[x-d,x+d]$} contains true score with, e.g., 95\% probability
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item 100 sentence translations evaluated

true score lies in interval \maths{$[\bar{x}-d,\bar{x}+d]$} around sample score \maths{$\bar{x}$}\\
